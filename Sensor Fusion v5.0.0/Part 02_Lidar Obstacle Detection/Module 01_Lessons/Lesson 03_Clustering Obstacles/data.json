It would be great to break up and group those obstacle points, especially if you want to do multiple object tracking with cars, pedestrians, and bicyclists, for instance. One way to do that grouping and cluster point cloud data is called euclidean clustering. \n\n## Euclidean Clustering\n\nThe idea is you associate groups of points by how close together they are. To do a nearest neighbor search efficiently, you use a KD-Tree data structure which, on average, speeds up your look up time from O(n) to O(log(n)). This is because the tree allows you to better break up your search space. By grouping points into regions in a KD-Tree, you can avoid calculating distance for possibly thousands of points just because you know they are not even considered in a close enough region.\n\nIn this lesson, you will begin by seeing how to do Euclidean clustering using built-in PCL functions. Next, you will write your own clustering algorithm using a KD-Tree. ***Your implementation will be used in your project submission, so be sure to complete the implementation in the exercises that follow!***",

              "text": "Inside `pointProcessor`, the `Clustering` function is located right under the `SegmentPlane` function that you previously were working on. \n\nPCL provides some documentation for using its built in [euclidean clustering](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/cluster_extraction.php) functions. In particular check out lines 71-82.  \n\n## Euclidean Clustering Arguments\n\nThe euclidean clustering object `ec` takes in a distance tolerance. Any points within that distance will be grouped together. It also has min and max arguments for the number of points to represent as clusters. The idea is: if a cluster is really small, it’s probably just noise and we are not concerned with it. Also a max number of points allows us to better break up very large clusters. If a cluster is very large it might just be that many other clusters are overlapping, and a max tolerance can help us better resolve the object detections. The last argument to the euclidean cluster object is the Kd-Tree. The tree is created and built using the input cloud points, which in this case are going to be the obstacle cloud points.  \n\nBack in environment.cpp let's see how to render the different clusters.\n\n```cpp\nstd::vector<pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ>::Ptr> cloudClusters = pointProcessor->Clustering(segmentCloud.first, 1.0, 3, 30);\n\t\nint clusterId = 0;\nstd::vector<Color> colors = {Color(1,0,0), Color(0,1,0), Color(0,0,1)};\n  \nfor(pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ>::Ptr cluster : cloudClusters)\n{\n  \tstd::cout << \"cluster size \";\n  \tpointProcessor->numPoints(cluster);\n  \trenderPointCloud(viewer,cluster,\"obstCloud\"+std::to_string(clusterId),colors[clusterId]);\n  \t++clusterId;\n}\n```\nIn the code above, the `Clustering` method is called and then there is a loop to iterate through each cluster and call `renderPointCloud` on each cluster. The renderPointCloud is expecting each pcl viewer point cloud to have a unique identifier, so clusters are counted with `clusterId` and appended to the `obstCloud` string. \nTo get different colors for each of the clusters, a list of colors is defined. Here we simply use red, blue and green.\n\nAs a bonus the number of points for each cluster is logged. This can be a helpful debugging tool later when trying to pick good min and max point values. \n\nIn this example the min points for a cluster are set to 3, and the max set to 30. The distance tolerance is also set to 1. Some time and effort will be needed to pick good hyperparameters, but many cases actually there won't be a perfect combination to always get perfect results.

              "text": "The previous concept showed how points are inserted into the tree. How about doing this in C++? Implementing a recursive helper function to insert points can be a very nice way to update Nodes. The basic idea is that the tree is traversed until the Node it arrives at is NULL, in which case a new Node is created and replaces the NULL Node. For assigning a Node, one way is to use a double pointer. You could pass in a pointer to the node, starting at root, and then when you want to replace a node you can dereference the double pointer and assign it to the newly created Node. Another way of achieving this is by using a pointer reference as well. For references, check out the code below for doing insertion in C++ but with a binary tree. The insertion for a KD-Tree will be very similar to this.\n\n## Example of Insertion for Binary Tree\n\n#### Double Pointer\n```cpp\nvoid insert(BinaryTreeNode **node, int data)\n   {\n      if(*node == NULL)\n      {\n        *node = getNewNode(data);\n      }\n      else if(data < (*node)->data)\n      {\n        insert(&(*node)->left, data);\n      }\n      else\n      {\n        insert(&(*node)->right, data);\n      }\n   }\n```\n\n#### Pointer Reference\n```cpp\nvoid insert(BinaryTreeNode *&node, int data)\n   {\n      if(node == NULL)\n      {\n        node = getNewNode(data);\n      }\n      else if(data < node->data)\n      {\n        insert(node->left, data);\n      }\n      else\n      {\n        insert(node->right, data);\n      }\n   }\n```\n\n\n## Instructions\nCheck out the quiz and try getting the resulting image from the previous concept, visually showing how each point is separating the x/y regions.\n\n- In `src/quiz/cluster/kdtree.h` fill in the `insert` function.\n\n## Compile/Run\n\n- In `src/quiz/cluster`, `mkdir build`\n- `cd build`\n- `cmake ..`\n- `make`\n- `./quizCluster`\n",

Points within a distance of `distanceTol` are considered to be nearby.  The KD-Tree is able to split regions and allows certain regions to be completely ruled out, speeding up the process of finding nearby neighbors. \n\nThe naive approach of finding nearby neighbors is to go through every single point in the tree and compare their distances with the target, selecting point indices that fall within the distance tolerance of the target. Instead with the KD-Tree you can compare distance within a boxed square that is 2 x `distanceTol` for length, centered around the target point. If the current node point is within this box then you can directly calculate the distance and see if the point id should be added to the list of nearby ids. Then you see if your box crosses over the node division region and if it does compare that next node. You do this recursively, with the advantage being that if the box region is not inside some division region you completely skip that branch.\n\n## Instructions\n\n- In `src/quiz/cluster/kdtree.h` fill in the `search` function.\n- Verify that when the code is run, line 115 of `cluster.cpp` produces the following output:\n```\nTest Search\n0,1,2,3,\n```\n- Experiment by using different point values in the call to `search` in line 115 of `cluster.cpp`. Use target points that are close to points in the tree.

The bounding box volume could also be thought of as space the car is not allowed to enter, or it would result in a collision. Your point processor already has a bounding box function all set up. This function is already predefined since it’s doing a very simple technique for generating a box. The function `BoundingBox` looks at the min and max point values of an input cloud and stores those parameters in a box struct container. To render bounding boxes around your clusters you can can add the following code inside the loop that renders clusters in `environment.cpp`.\n\n```cpp\nBox box = pointProcessor->BoundingBox(cluster);\nrenderBox(viewer,box,clusterId);\n```\nThe results of doing this are shown in the image above.\n## Instructions\n\n- In `src/environment.cpp` add the renderBox function to render boxes around clusters\n",

It would be nice to take into account box rotation in the XY plane, about the Z axis. Rotation about the X or Y axes would yield weird results, since the car in the majority of situations is not concerned with the Z dimension, or has any control over Z movement. \n\nThe file containing the box struct is located in `src/render/box.h` and contains an additional struct called `BoxQ`. This struct has a quaternion member that allows rotations. Also there is an additional `renderBox` function in render.cpp that takes a BoxQ argument and renders the rotational box. There is a blog post about fitting the smallest possible 3D box around a 3D point cloud [here](http://codextechnicanum.blogspot.com/2015/04/find-minimum-oriented-bounding-box-of.html). The solution in the post uses [PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis), principal component analysis and includes Z axis rotations as well. A challenge problem is then to find the smallest fitting box but which is oriented flat with the XY plane.",
