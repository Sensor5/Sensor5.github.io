00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.710
How does the noise vector affect
the overall process model?

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.090
Let's do this again row for row starting
from the bottom with the yaw rate.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.655
Assuming the yaw
acceleration nu psi dot dot

00:00:14.655 --> 00:00:18.565
is constant between k and k + one.

00:00:18.565 --> 00:00:22.275
It will just linearly add up to
the yaw rate with increasing time.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.605
So,the influence of the yaw
acceleration on the yaw rate

00:00:27.605 --> 00:00:30.265
is the yaw acceleration times delta t.

00:00:31.455 --> 00:00:35.729
Can you calculate the influence of the
noise processes nu a and nu psi dot dot

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:38.846
new sin delta on the yaw angle and
the velocity.

00:00:38.846 --> 00:00:42.192
Consider that the longitudinal
acceleration noise nu a

00:00:42.192 --> 00:00:45.543
is also constant
between k and k + one.
