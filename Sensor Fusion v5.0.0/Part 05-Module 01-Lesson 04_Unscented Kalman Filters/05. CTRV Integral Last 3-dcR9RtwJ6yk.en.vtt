00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.856
We have the complete differential
equation now, awesome.

00:00:03.856 --> 00:00:07.090
But how do we get from time
step k to time step k+1?

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:13.930
Let's say the discrete time step k
relates to the continuous time value tk,

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.334
and the discrete time step k+1 relates
to the continuous time value tk + 1.

00:00:19.334 --> 00:00:24.720
The difference between tk +1 and
tk is called delta t.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.960
Then this state at time k + 1
is given by the state of time k,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.370
plus the integral over x-dot,
from time tk to time tk + 1.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.440
This can potentially be
a very complex calculation.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.160
But in the special case of the CTRV,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.570
this integral can be
solved pretty easily.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.060
In the first two rows, I will just
insert the terms of the differential

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.790
equation without solving the integral,
we will do this later.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.240
Let's start with the last three
rows which are the easiest.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.180
Even if you don't really remember
how to solve an integral,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.050
you still might be able to choose
the correct answer in the quiz below.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.780
Remember we assume the yaw rate and
the velocity are constant.
