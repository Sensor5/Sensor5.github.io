00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.120
The model we've used so far assumes
objects always keep going straight.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.590
The model we will use from now on
assumes objects can move straight, but

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.910
they can also move with a constant turn
rate and a constant velocity magnitude.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.030
This model is often
called the CTRV model.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.814
Let's have a look at the state
vector we are going to use.

00:00:18.814 --> 00:00:23.431
We keep calling the two-dimensional
position of the bike px and py,

00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:26.070
where p stands for position.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.890
But instead of describing the velocity
with vx and vy, we use the speed and

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.320
yaw angle.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.995
The speed is the magnitude of
the velocity, which we'll call v.

00:00:35.995 --> 00:00:40.940
And the yaw angle is the orientation,
which we'll call psi.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.590
Since we also want to be able to
estimate the yaw rate psi dot,

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.740
we add it to the state vector too.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.600
Constant yaw rate and
constant speed is a good model for

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.260
vehicle behavior in
real traffic scenarios.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.510
Let's try to get a feeling for that.
