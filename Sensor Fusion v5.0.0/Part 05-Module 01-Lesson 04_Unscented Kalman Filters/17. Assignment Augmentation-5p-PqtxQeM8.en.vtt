00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.600
Okay, let's put
the augmentation into C++ code.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.860
Now the dimension of
the augmented state is 7.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.600
Other things you will need
are the variance of the longitudinal

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.710
acceleration and the yaw acceleration.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.520
Together, they build the process noise
covariance matrix which we call Q.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.790
The rest is almost the same
as in the last session.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.430
But this time, you have to build
the augmented state mean x_aug, and

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.410
the augmented covariance matrix P_aug.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.350
Again, have a look at the cheat sheet,
it will also help you here.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.014
When you build the augmented mean state,

00:00:35.014 --> 00:00:39.600
consider that the mean value of
the acceleration noises are both zero.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.470
And this is where
the augmented sigma points go.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.230
Pay attention to
the dimensions of this matrix.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.180
Good luck with the quiz.
