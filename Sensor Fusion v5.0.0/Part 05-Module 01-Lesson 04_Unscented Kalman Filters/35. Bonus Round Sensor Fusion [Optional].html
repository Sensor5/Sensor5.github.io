          Nice work reaching the end of the sensor fusion content! While you still have the project left to do here, we're also providing some additional resources and recent research on the topic that you can come back to if you have time later on.
         </p>
         <p>
          Reading research papers is a great way to get exposure to the latest and greatest in the field, as well as expand your learning. However, just like the project ahead, it's often best to
          <em>
           learn by doing
          </em>
          - if you find a paper that really excites you, try to implement it (or even something better) yourself!

            Abstract:
           </strong>
           Online multi-object tracking (MOT) is extremely important for high-level spatial reasoning and path planning for autonomous and highly-automated vehicles. In this paper, we present a modular framework for tracking multiple objects (vehicles), capable of accepting object proposals from different
           <br/>
           sensor modalities (vision and range) and a variable number of sensors, to produce continuous object tracks. […]
           <br/>
           We demonstrate that our framework is well-suited to track objects through entire maneuvers around the ego-vehicle, some of which take more than a few minutes to complete. We also leverage the modularity of our approach by comparing the effects of including/excluding different sensors, changing the total number of sensors, and the quality of object proposals on the final tracking result.

           Traditional vision-based 3-D motion estimation algorithms require given or calculated 3-D models while the motion is being tracked. We propose a high-speed extended Kalman filter-based approach that recovers camera position and orientation from stereo image sequences without prior knowledge as well as the procedure for the reconstruction of 3-D structures.

           Vehicle Tracking and Motion Estimation Based on Stereo Vision Sequences

           </strong>
           In this dissertation, a novel approach for estimating trajectories of road vehicles such as
           <br/>
           cars, vans, or motorbikes, based on stereo image sequences is presented. Moving objects
           <br/>
           are detected and reliably tracked in real-time from within a moving car. […]
           <br/>
           The focus of this contribution is on oncoming traffic, while most existing work in the literature
           <br/>
           addresses tracking the lead vehicle. The overall approach is generic and scalable
           <br/>
           to a variety of traffic scenes including inner city, country road, and highway scenarios. […]
           <br/>
           The key idea is to derive these parameters from a set of tracked 3D points on the
           <br/>
           object’s surface, which are registered to a time-consistent object coordinate system, by
           <br/>
           means of an extended Kalman filter. Combining the rigid 3D point cloud model with
           <br/>
           the dynamic model of a vehicle is one main contribution of this thesis. […]
           <br/>
           The experimental results show the proposed system is able to accurately estimate the
           <br/>
           object pose and motion parameters in a variety of challenging situations, including night
           <br/>
           scenes, quick turn maneuvers, and partial occlusions.

           In this paper we propose a novel deep neural network that is able to jointly reason about 3D detection, tracking and motion forecasting given data captured by a 3D sensor. By jointly reasoning about these tasks, our holistic approach is more robust to occlusion as well as sparse data at range. Our approach performs 3D convolutions across space and time over a bird’s eye view representation of the 3D world, which is very efficient in terms of both memory and computation. Our experiments on a new very large scale dataset captured in several north american cities, show that we can outperform the state-of-the-art by a
           <br/>
           large margin. Importantly, by sharing computation we can perform all tasks in as little as 30 ms.

           Accurate detection of objects in 3D point clouds is a central problem in many applications, such as autonomous navigation, housekeeping robots, and augmented/virtual reality. To interface a highly sparse LiDAR point cloud with a region proposal network (RPN), most existing efforts have focused on hand-crafted feature representations, for example, a bird's eye view projection. In this work, we remove the need of manual feature engineering for 3D point clouds and propose VoxelNet, a generic 3D detection network that unifies feature extraction and bounding box prediction into a single stage, end-to-end trainable deep network. […] Experiments on the KITTI car detection benchmark show that VoxelNet outperforms the state-of-the-art LiDAR based 3D detection methods by a large margin. Furthermore, our network learns an effective discriminative representation of objects with various geometries, leading to encouraging results in 3D detection of pedestrians and cyclists, based on only LiDAR.
