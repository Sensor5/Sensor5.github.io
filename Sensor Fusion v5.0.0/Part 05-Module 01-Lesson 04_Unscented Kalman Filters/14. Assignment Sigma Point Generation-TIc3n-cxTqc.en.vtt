00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.550
Welcome to the first coding
quiz in this lesson.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.150
Let's go ahead and
put what we have learned into C++.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.540
In this quiz you will write a small
function that generates sigma points.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.610
I've prepared the template for you and

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.079
I would like to quickly
make you familiar with it.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.770
You will be working on a function
called GenerateSigmaPoints.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.050
Which receives a pointer
to a matrix as input.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.840
This is where you are expected
to write your result.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.550
I will show you how this works
in the end of the function.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.170
This time, we will consider
the complete state of the CTRV model.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.220
So we set the state dimension n_x to 5.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.300
Here we set the design parameter
lambda to 3- n_x as suggested before.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.330
Then we set the example set x and

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.650
the example covariance matrix
P to some realistic values.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.320
Now we create a matrix called Xsig.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.830
This is a matrix with five rows and
11 columns.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.900
This is where I want you to
store the sigma points later.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.540
Now here, I give you a little help for

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.070
calculating the square root matrix
of the covariance matrix P.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.050
What you see here are two function calls
which are part of the Eigen library.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.280
It performs a Cholesky decomposition and
provides the result we need.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.790
Feel free to Google this approach,
if you want to know more about it.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.662
This is where you're
supposed to put your code.

00:01:17.662 --> 00:01:20.999
I would like you to calculate
all 11 sigma points and

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:24.600
fill the columns of Xsig
with the sigma points.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.140
One thing is important,
when you fill this matrix,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.770
use the same ordering of sigma
points as I showed you in the video,

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.580
to make sure the evaluation works.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.610
In the end, the result will be printed,
so you can check if it's realistic.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.900
We received the pointer
Xsig_out as input.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.500
It points to a matrix.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.610
This is how we put our
result into this matrix.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.700
Please don't change anything
outside the student area

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.940
to make sure your result
can be evaluated correctly.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.730
Some of the challenges of these
programming assignments are related to

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.270
handling rows and columns of
matrices with the Eigen library.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.580
Check link to the Eigen cheat sheet
in the assignment description,

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.630
that will help you a lot.
