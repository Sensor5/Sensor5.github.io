00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.800
It's really great to see you made it all
the way through this challenging lesson.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.290
In the project description, you will
find everything you need to know to

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.500
successfully complete the project.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.030
In this video,

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.280
I would like to point out some things
about the UKF I find quite remarkable.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.260
And I also want to explain why
a Kalman filter in general

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.190
is such an important tool for
self driving cars.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.920
Let's have a look at
the scenario in the project.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.570
You have seen a similar plot
before in the EKF project.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.400
We see here a bicycle that is
first driving straight and

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.970
then turning into a circle.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.700
The path of the bicycle
is shown in blue.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.160
The green line is the sequence of all
measurements we receive both from LiDAR

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.950
and radar.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.140
As before,
these measurements are quite noisy.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.020
The orange dots are the estimation
results of the UKF fusing laser and

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.360
radar measurements.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.160
Remember, the linear process
model in the last project

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.380
had problems following the turn.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.060
The CTRV model we're using this time
follows the turn quite nicely, and

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.070
still provides a smooth
position estimate.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.650
You can play around with
the process noise values, and

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.550
make the estimation even smoother.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.520
Or force it to follow
the measurements quicker.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.650
When you change
the process noise values,

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.540
also make sure to check
the consistency of your filter.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.510
This is how the consistency
check of my filter looks like.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.833
What you see here in orange are the NIS
values of the three dimensional radar

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:23.810
measurements.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.100
I also plotted the 95% line in blue.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.670
Just as expected, a small number
if NIS values exceed this line.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.020
If your NIS values look like this,

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.100
you know you have set
up a consistent filter.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.450
This is how the NIS values of
the laser measurements look like.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.620
Be aware that the 95% line is at
a different level in this case

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.050
because the laser measurement
is a two dimensional vector.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.450
The project description will give you
details about the exact criteria for

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.660
a successful consistency check.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.470
Remember if the UKF is consistent,

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.369
it means it provides
a realistic covariance matrix.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.660
The UKF also estimates the velocity
of the bicycle of course.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.670
It can do it with or without radar.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.650
But if you compare these two options,
you will find out

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:15.000
that the velocity estimate converges
much faster if you use the radar too.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.890
Give it a try and switch on and
off both sensors, and

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.600
see how they contribute
in different ways.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.442
What I find really impressive is
how precise the UKF can estimate

00:02:24.442 --> 00:02:26.446
the orientation of the bicycle.

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:30.030
None of our sensors is able to
directly observe the orientation, but

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.650
we still get a precise estimate.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.620
Even the yaw rate can be estimated
providing useful results.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.180
For autonomous vehicles,

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.380
the yaw rate of other vehicles
is very important to know.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.970
Imagine another car
starting to change lanes or

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.020
a bicycle in front of you
wants to do a left turn.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.880
Hopefully, they would both signalize
their intention but in the end

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.790
the yaw rate is the ultimate indicator
for such a behavior prediction.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.215
Let's summarize the three most
important properties of the UKF as

00:02:58.215 --> 00:03:00.370
a sensor fusion tool for
self driving cars.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.175
Number one, with the UKF, you will be able
to take noisy measurement data as input and

00:03:05.175 --> 00:03:06.942
provide a smooth position and

00:03:06.942 --> 00:03:12.860
velocity estimation of dynamic objects
around you, without introducing a delay.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.258
Number two, you can provide
an estimation of the orientation and

00:03:16.258 --> 00:03:20.337
the yaw rate of other vehicles using
sensors that can't even directly observe

00:03:20.337 --> 00:03:21.156
these things.

00:03:21.156 --> 00:03:23.878
And number three, in addition to that,

00:03:23.878 --> 00:03:27.892
the UKF also gives information
on how precise the result is,

00:03:27.892 --> 00:03:31.851
because it always provides a covariance
matrix for every estimation.

00:03:31.851 --> 00:03:36.427
And you know that this covariance
matrix is realistic if the UKF performs

00:03:36.427 --> 00:03:38.800
a consistency check.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.420
The uncertainty of the estimation result
is very important for self driving cars.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.720
Because if the position of your leading
vehicle is quite uncertain at some time,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.220
you better keep a little more distance
