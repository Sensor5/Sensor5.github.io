But LIDARs fail in bad weather conditions as the very small wavelength doesn’t allow to work well in fog or rain. Additionally, LIDAR is an expensive sensor with costs varying from  $35,000 to $100,000 as of 2019. Lidar is the preferred technology at Waymo. \n\nRadar lacks the capability to generate a high resolution image, but it has highly accurate velocity estimation based on the doppler phenomenon, which we will cover in more detail later in this course. \nAlso, radar wavelength allows it to sense the targets in bad weather conditions as well. Most important is the low manufacturing cost for a Radar. A radar unit can cost as low as a few hundred dollars, allowing a car manufacturer to deploy multiple Radar sensors for 360 degree perception. Tesla relies on Radar as its primary sensor and doesn’t include LIDAR in its sensor fusion system. \n\n[Read how Delphi](https://www.mathworks.com/company/user_stories/delphi-develops-radar-sensor-alignment-algorithm-for-automotive-active-safety-system.html)   used MATLAB and code generation to implement a radar safety system",

The sawtooth waveform generally uses just the upramps, whereas the triangular waveform uses both upramps and downramps. \n\nEach chirp is defined by its slope. The slope is given by its chirp frequency bandwidth <span class=\"mathquill\">B</span> or <span class=\"mathquill\">B_{sweep}</span> (y-axis) and its chirp time <span class=\"mathquill\">T_s</span> (x-axis).

The Antenna also increases the strength of the signal by focusing the energy in the desired direction. Additionally, the antenna pattern determines the field of view for the radar.\n\n**Mixer**: In FMCW radar, the _mixer_ multiplies the return signal with the sweeping signal generated by the frequency synthesizer. The operation works as frequency subtraction to give the frequency delta - also known as frequency shift or Intermediate frequency (IF). IF = Synthesizer Frequency - Return Signal Frequency.\n\n**Processor**: The _processor_ is the processing unit where all the Digital Signal processing, Detection, Tracking, Clustering, and other algorithms take place.

The peaks correspond to the strength of the return signal from targets and the frequency relates to the range. Relationship between frequency and range will be discussed in next lesson. \n\nA radar cannot detect a signal that is below the noise level. The noise level is determined by the thermal noise generated by the receiver. To successfully detect a target, the return signal strength needs to be larger than the noise level. This is defined by a property called _signal to noise ratio_, or _SNR.\n\nSNR is a quantitative measure of a signal strength as compared to the level of noise. If the SNR is too low it becomes difficult for a radar to distinguish the signal from noise. Hence, higher SNR is desirable for successful detection of the target. Generally, a 7-13 dB SNR ensures successful detection in a road scenario.",
